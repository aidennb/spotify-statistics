# Final Project for DSCI-351, Fall 2023

# This project is an analysis on the "Spotify - All Time Top 2000s" dataset provided by Spotify: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsumat/spotify-top-2000s-mega-dataset

# The .ipynb file contains the final demo and project elements for grading. Please note that this file is formatted for Jupyter Notebook, but can not be run/executed on Github. It must be downloaded, along with MySQL, Python, and all of the necessary API's and run locally.

# I have also included the code in a .py file.
